# Ternary-Huffman-Data-Compression
Ternary Huffman Tree compression extends traditional Huffman coding by using three branches instead of two, allowing more efficient symbol encoding. This method assigns shorter codes to frequent symbols, reducing file size for text and images while maintaining data integrity.
